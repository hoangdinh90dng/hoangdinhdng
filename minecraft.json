He went to physical therapy, did his own therapy at home, and found a trainer to help him push further. In a year he was walking; in two he was playing sports. This experience taught him a few things that would stick with him for life. - Don’t take life for granted. - He had to delve into himself to get through the experience and he learned to understand himself, his motivations as well as his place in the world. - A side effect of this was that he could now read and understand the people around him in the same ways. - He also wanted to make his body and mind stronger to never be injured the same way again",
