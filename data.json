Health replenishes when players have a nearly full hunger bar or continuously on peaceful difficulty.\n \nPlayers can craft a wide variety of items in Minecraft. Craftable items include armor, which mitigates damage from attacks; weapons (such as swords or axes), which allows monsters and animals to be killed more easily; and tools, which break certain types of blocks more quickly. \nSome items have multiple tiers depending on the material used to craft them, with higher-tier items being more effective and durable.\nPlayers can construct furnaces, which can cook food, process ores, and convert materials into other materials. \nPlayers may also exchange goods with a villager (NPC) through a trading system, which involves trading emeralds for different goods and vice versa. \n \nThe game has an inventory system, allowing players to carry a limited number of items. Upon dying, items in the players' inventories are dropped unless the game is reconfigured not to do so. Players then re-spawn at their spawn point, which by default is where players first spawn in the game, and can be reset by sleeping in a bed or using a respawn anchor.\nDropped items can be recovered if players can reach them before they disappear or despawn after 5 minutes. Players may acquire experience points by killing mobs and other players, mining, smelting ores, breeding animals, and cooking food.\nExperience can then be spent on enchanting tools, armor and weapons. Enchanted items are generally more powerful, last longer, or have other special effects"

Items can be placed in or taken out of a storage minecart through the use of a Hopper, but not surprisingly, by a Minecart with Hopper. Minecarts with chests can be accessed at any time when a player is in range, and there is not a solid block between them and the minecart, even if there is a block above the minecart. A minecart with chest won't show the opening animation/sound as regular chests do.\n\n\nUsage:\nMinecarts with chests can be used to store items without anybody seeing - "hiding" the item - or simply used, for example, to add Books to a "library." This is done with: any block of a player's choice, a minecart with chest, a Button, a Piston, and a Rail. For the block of a player's choice, use a Bookshelf. First, delete a vertical row of 2 blocks (do NOT destroy the block that touches the ground). Put a rail on the block and then place the minecart.\nDestroy the block that was placed on the rail and minecart on top of it. The minecart will fall down and the rail will be destroyed (remember: the minecart will turn around when the block is destroyed, so it's recommended that the rail is facing towards the direction that a player was looking). Next, place down a piston looking down and insert a button on the block nearest to the piston. Then, place the bookshelf under the piston and press the button. The bookshelf will go through the minecart. Now, destroy the piston and place down bookshelves to fill the empty spaces.\nNote that, if the minecart switches direction away from the direction a player was looking at, then a part of the minecart will show up when the button pushed, and that will show everyone else where the minecart is, so it's highly suggested to make sure the minecart isn't looking vertically",

The minecart with command block is used to run commands and travel. It can be more useful than a command block in some situations, and less useful in others. For example, a benefit of command block minecarts is that one does not need to give it input from a Clock circuit; for as long as it is powered, it will repeatedly run the command, once every four game ticks (five times per second). Relative coordinates can be very useful in minecart command block commands. For example, giving the XYZ as 6, 2, 0 (without the quote marks) means the block that is 6 South and 2 up from the minecart's current location. Since the minecart's location is constantly changing, a setblock command using relative coordinates can draw a wall (poorly and with gaps).
